# This is my collection of jupyter notebooks

Most of these are designed for planning a party, feel free to use them if you want.

This is made using Nix (on NixOS, but it should work on any system Nix is installable to, which would be any system).

To run, just type

> nix run

Have fun :)

(don't know why I've made this repo public, but if it helps, use it)
